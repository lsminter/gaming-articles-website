I've only build one full application before, my [streamer app](https://github.com/lsminter/next-streamer-center). It's very difficult to see what's going on in the code base because I didn't have any fundamental understanding of how to organize an application. With this application, I really want to focus on keeping things clean and clear so that anyone else can read and understand what I'm doing. 

The next thing I really want to focus on is really understanding authentication. In that `streamer app`, I implemented Twitch.tv's authentication that made it easy to pull a user's info. To tell you the truth, I know next to nothing about it. I worked with a friend that helped me to implement it. I followed tutorials and copy/pasted the code so I never got a real understanding of what the code even does. 

I've started to implement firebase authentication into my gaming articles website. This time around, I want to write the code myself, run into problems and fix them myself. I really want to make sure that the code that I'm implementing into my app that I understand all of it to the point where I can explain it to someone else. 

This past week, I've been working on making a very simple home page and login page using Next and Tailwind. Next has made making a multi page application very easy. All you have to do is just make another .js file in the pages directory and there you go. You've made another route. 

I've also made Header and Footer components that I can use on every page using Tailwind. Tailwind has been relatively easy to learn. The main difficulty is trying to remember the names of things. What made this really easy was this [Transformation Tool](https://transform.tools/css-to-tailwind). I am fairly familiar with CSS so all I had to do is plug in my css to this tool and it would output my tailwind code. I had trouble editing the properties of text in a `<Link>` using Tailwind. My work around was using an `<h1>` inside of that `<Link>` and I can edit the properties of that <h1> to change how the text looks.

I've added in a `handleSubmit` to my `<form>` that only just logs out a string. This is where my authentication is going to come into play. When someone hits the `submit` button, it'll log them in. I'm going to need to make a second form for users to be able to sign up as well. 

## Resources/quick notes
Learning about having components in a separate file and then importing those into the main file. Makes for much cleaner code that's much easier to read. 

Using Link from next to navigate between pages. 

I can't change the text properties inside of a <Link> but if I put the text inside of another element like h1 inside of that Link, then I can change the text properties. 

This site saved my life https://transform.tools/css-to-tailwind.

Learning how to get tailwind setup for the first time. The tailwind documents made it very easy to set up. https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs

Adam Wathan's course on how to [build a Responsive Navbar with Tailwind](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-responsive-navbar-with-tailwind-4d328a35) was super helpful for getting mine initially setup. 

Working through this [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/implement-user-authentication-with-next-js-and-firebase-fb9414adba08) to learn how to implement firebase authentication.
