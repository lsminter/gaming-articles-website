# Gaming Articles Website.

The purpose of the Gaming Articles Website is to give gamers a place to write their own articles and display them to other users. Here, gamers can start conversations around any topic one might present. 

## Signing In

Upon entering the website, users will only be able to view articles. Once signed in, they will be able to comment and create/post their own articles. Users will have a set amount of articles they can post a week. Users will also be able to follow other users to see when they post an article. 

## User Profiles

I'd like for users to be able to have their own dashboard where they can edit their own articles and have a small bio about themselves. On the profile page, there will be a list of all of the users articles. 

## Premium Accounts
These accounts will have less restrictions on the amount of articles they can post. These users will be identified by a symbol next to their name. 

## Next.js, Stripe, Firebase
This application will be built on Next.js for the front end. Stipe will handle the payment side of things. Firebase will be used for user authentication. 


## notes
This is pretty basic so far. These are just some initial thoughts as to what I want the site to be. As the application is build out, I would like to add images of different parts such as the sign in process and some basic templates for articles/profiles.
